                Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who Founded X.com in 1999 (which later became
                PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his
                start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a
                rocket that would send the first commercial adfvehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio
                with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role
                in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration. In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as
                the wealthiest man in the world.A third rocket, the Falcon Heavy (first launched in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly twice as much as its largest competitor, the Boeing Company’s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the cost. SpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy–Starship system.The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit.
                The payload would be the Starship, a spacecraft designed for providing fast transportation between cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and Mars.
